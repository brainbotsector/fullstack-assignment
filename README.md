# Help Center API Assignment

## How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
Shared Functionality Across a Component Tree:

Context API: This allows components to share common data or functionality without needing to pass it down through every level of the component tree. It acts like a central store for data or functions that multiple components can access.

Custom Hooks: These are reusable pieces of logic that can be shared across components. They allow encapsulating common functionality, making it easy to reuse across different parts of the application.

Higher-Order Components (HOCs): These are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional features. They provide a way to extend or modify the behavior of components without altering their core logic.

## Why is the useState hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?

Local State Management: useState allows each component to maintain its own state independently, which is crucial for managing complex components where different parts of the component might need to track different pieces of information.

Simplicity: useState offers a straightforward way to manage state with minimal setup. It simplifies state management by allowing components to hold and update their own state easily.

Encapsulation: State is kept within the component where it is used. This keeps the state management isolated and prevents unintended side effects from other components.

Multiple States: Components can have multiple state variables managed separately, which helps in handling different aspects of the componentâ€™s state independently.

Functional Updates: useState supports functional updates, ensuring that state changes are based on the most recent state value, which is useful in dynamic environments where state updates depend on previous state values.

This project features a full-stack Help Center application with a user-friendly interface built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, supported by MongoDB as the database.

## Features:

Help Center Card Management: Users can add, retrieve, and view all branches within the help center. This functionality allows for easy management and organization of various help center cards.

Account Management: Under the "Manage Your Account" section, users can create new accounts, update their details, and view their information using their email ID.

Data Management: All user and branch data is efficiently stored and managed using MongoDB. Three schema models were designed for handling branches and user data.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive full-stack solution with a focus on creating a user-friendly and efficient help center application.
